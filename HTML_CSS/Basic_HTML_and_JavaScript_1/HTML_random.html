    <summary>Final journey for the last space shuttle...</summary>
    <p>
        <pre>
            The final journey for the last space shuttle ever built is complete.
            
            Set against the black backdrop of the night sky, a crane hoisted a white shrink-wrapped Endeavour 200 feet overhead before gently lowering it to its ultimate resting space, outside the California Science Center, on Tuesday morning.
            
            Endeavour was stacked vertically and affixed to an already positioned external tank and two solid rocket boosters, the last leg of its 19-year career, which included 25 space voyages.
            
            The orbiter's last mission, however, is not to touch the stars, but to inspire the next generation of space explorers, serving as the pièce de résistance of the still-under-construction Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center.
            
            "It's been a very quick process tonight, and I think we've exceeded expectations," said Jeffrey Rudolph, president of the California Science Center. "We were fortunate with good weather and not too much wind."
            
            The full-stack launch position of Endeavour is rare; no other space shuttle is displayed in such a way. In fact, for the last 11 years, Endeavour has rested in a horizontal position inside the California Science Center, awaiting the move to its permanent home.

            The orbiter’s placement marks the first time a shuttle designed for space was assembled vertically outside of a NASA or Air Force facility.
            
            Shortly after 9:30 p.m. Monday, as crowds watched from State Drive, crews used an 11-story crane to hoist Endeavour’s tail while a larger, 40-story crawler crane used a sling to carefully lift its nose.
            
            The move started 30 minutes earlier than anticipated, with officials saying calmer-than-expected winds prompted them to act. The installation was livestreamed.
            
            When the shuttle was pointing upward, the smaller of the cranes was removed. The larger one then began lowering the orbiter just after midnight.
